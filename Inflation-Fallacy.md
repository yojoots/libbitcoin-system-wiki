Bitcoin [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) create a period of [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation). There is a theory that this causes the money to lose [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power). As shown in [Inflation Principle](Inflation-Principle), **no change in purchasing power is implied by supply increase** of a [market money](Money-Taxonomy). The theory is therefore invalid.

The fact that Bitcoin is not price inflationary implies that [owners](Glossary#owner) do not "subsidize" [mining](Glossary#mine). The capital consumed by [miners](Glossary#miner) is their own ([investment](Glossary#lend)), the money created is their own product, and the return on investment ([interest](Glossary#interest)) is a consequence of the increase in demand that they alone provide - offsetting the [opportunity cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of deploying their own capital over time.
