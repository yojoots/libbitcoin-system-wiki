A shitcoin is any system that is not [cryptodynamically secure](Cryptodynamic-Principles) yet purports to capture the [value proposition](Value-Proposition) of Bitcoin.

Shitcoins are presumed to be scams, though it remains possible for proponents be to well-intentioned yet ignorant of cryptodynamic principles. By way of example, [proof-of-stake](Proof-of-Stake-Fallacy) technologies are shitcoins.

While there may be implementations of Bitcoin that are more secure than others, these are matters of degree. No Bitcoin can be shown to be [absolutely secure](Axiom-of-Resistance). As such the term is not reasonably applied to any Bitcoin. By way of example, [proof-of-memory](Proof-of-Memory-Facade) technologies may not be shitcoins (despite failure to achieve stated objectives).
