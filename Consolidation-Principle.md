The need to [exchange](Glossary#exchange) from one [coin](Glossary#coin) in order to [trade](Glossary#trade) with [merchants](Glossary#merchant) of another is a cost. This cost must be non-zero even if automated, as it must consume space and/or time. As such one coin is always "better" (higher [utility](Glossary#utility)) than two, to the extent that the resulting coin does not become [fee](Glossary#fee) bound as implied by the [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property).

We can reasonably assume that two distinct moneys cannot perpetually have identical utility. [Thiers' Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law#Reverse_of_Gresham.27s_Law_.28Thiers.27_Law.29) discusses the consequences of better money in the absence of [state](Glossary#state) controls. From this we necessarily conclude that **the better of the two monies will eventually replace the other** in the absence of state controls. As this occurs utility accrues to the surviving coin in the reverse of the manner detailed in [Fragmentation Principle](Fragmentation-Principle).

This does not imply that new coins cannot be created or exist over a significant amount of time. It implies that there is a [market](Glossary#market) pressure toward a single coin. A better money in one situation may not be a better or even useful money in another. For example, gold is not a useful money for electronic [transfer](Glossary#transfer) and bitcoin is not very useful without a network. One money replaces another in the scenarios for which the former is better.
