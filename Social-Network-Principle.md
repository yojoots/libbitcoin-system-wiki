In the terminology of [Paul Baran's 1964 paper on distributed networks](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs217/Baran64.pdf) the importance of topology in network design is in the ability of communications to withstand the loss of a certain number of nodes. A centralized (star) network will fail with the loss of one node. A distributed (mesh) network is more resilient. A hybrid of these systems is considered decentralized.

As a money Bitcoin forms a social graph. Only a [person](Glossary#person) can decide to accept one money or another in [trade](Glossary#trade). A set of people sharing the same definition for a money is referred to as a [consensus](Glossary#consensus). Authority in a monetary system is the [power](Glossary#power) to define the money. Bitcoin is a tool that people can use defend against the tendency toward authority, in order to preserve their agreement and therefore [utility](Glossary#utility) in the money.

**In distributed systems terminology a Bitcoin "node" is a person and the system is money.** It does not matter how many [machines](Glossary#machine) the person controls, the loss of that person is a loss of a node in the system (including all of the person's machines). A centralized money cannot withstand the loss of one person. If that one person changes their rules, the original money ceases to exist. As shown in [Risk Sharing Principle](Risk-Sharing-Principle), Bitcoin relies on decentralization to allow people to resist authority. This decentralization makes the money more able to withstand the loss of more people when faced with [state](Glossary#state) attacks. A loss is in this sense is the refusal of the person to trade in the money.
