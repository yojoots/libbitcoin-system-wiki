The [Regression Theorem](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem) relies on the assumption that the first [people](Glossary#person) to [value](Glossary#value) something as a [money](Money-Taxonomy) must do so based on a memory of its prior [use value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value), with the thing eventually obtaining [barter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) [utility](Glossary#utility) and finally monetary value.

Notice that the theory does not merely attempt to explain the origin of the money *concept*, but of anything that can be a money. In other words, if a good does not follow this progression, it is not money.

The theorem contradicts the [subjective theory of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) upon which it relies. Value is subjective, which implies it can be based on anything, even if objectively that basis appears irrational.

**The theorem fails to terminate its regression by not explaining how a person comes to value something for its *original* utility.** One must *assume* (not remember) something will be useful if nobody has ever attempted to use it. This assumption of utility is the first valuation, which remains subjective. The first valuation of a thing, like all after, can be for any reason, including its [utility as a money](Collectible-Tautology).

Given a preexisting concept of money, it has been [suggested](https://mises.org/library/cryptocurrencies-and-wider-regression-theorem) that anticipation of being a money is sufficient to satisfy the theorem. In other words the money does not need to follow the progression in actual practice. In this case, given a preexisting concept of money, *anything* can begin as money. This interpretation renders the theorem tautological - anything that people value as money can be money. In other words, it reduces to subjective first value.

The theorem is actually based on the empirical observation of monetary evolution. Yet the [rational economic theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics) on which it is based, and the theorem itself, explicitly reject empiricism.

> All these statements implied in the regression theorem are enounced apodictically as implied in the apriorism of praxeology. It must happen this way. Nobody can ever succeed in construction a hypothetical case in which things were to occur in a different way.

One of many problems with empirical economics is that new observations can invalidate previous conclusions. Bitcoin has done so to this theorem. It can clearly be observed that Satoshi [intended to create a money](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), for its first use as money.

The idea is a reasonable empirical theory on the evolution of the concept of money, but invalid as a rational theorem to distinguish money from non-money. Money is distinguished by certain behaviors expressed by people. Concluding that something is a money consists of observing those behaviors, a strictly empirical method.
