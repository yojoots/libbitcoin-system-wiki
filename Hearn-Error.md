There is a theory that [states](Glossary#state) cannot ban popular things.

This implies that high [transaction](Glossary#transaction) throughput allows effective defense against [attacks](Glossary#attack) and [coercion](Glossary#coercion). This in turn implies that Bitcoin can be secured by accepting the [centralizing](Glossary#centralization) force of very high transaction throughput.

The theory is invalid, as it rests on a factual error. **It is evident that states actually *prefer* to ban popular things.** The following is a short list of commonly-banned popular things:

* Drugs
* Gambling
* Prostitution
* Speech
* Assembly
* Trade
* Migration
* Weapons
* Labor
* Books
* Money

This error may arise from failure to accept the [Axiom of Resistance](Axiom-of-Resistance) while continuing to work in Bitcoin. This is likely to produce [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). The subsequent search for relief may lead one here. However the error eventually becomes undeniable, which may lead to a [rage-quit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rage_quit).
