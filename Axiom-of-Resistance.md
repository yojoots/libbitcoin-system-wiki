In modern logic an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) is a premise, it cannot be proven. It is a starting assumption against which other things may be proven. For example, in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) one cannot prove that parallel lines never meet. It simply defines the particular geometry.

Proving statements about Bitcoin requires reliance on other systems, specifically [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory), [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) and [catallactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics), and therefore the assumptions upon which they rely. However Bitcoin also relies on an axiom not found in these systems. Satoshi alludes to this in an early [statement](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/4):

>> You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.

> Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.

> Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

In other words there is an assumption that it is *possible* for a system to resist [state](Glossary#state) control. This is not accepted as a fact but deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to the behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.

**One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an entirely different system than Bitcoin.** If one assumes it is *not possible* for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not make sense in the context of Bitcoin; just as conclusions in [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry) contradict Euclidean. For example, without the axiom, how can Bitcoin be trustless and a sound money? In this case, does sound money not require trust that the state will not subvert its foundations? This leads one to make [obvious errors](Hearn-Error) in an attempt to rationalize the conflict.

It is common for people to refer cynically to a Bitcoin-like system that omits the resistance axiom as just another "PayPal", a designation not without merit. [Confinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity) originally attempted to create a system with a similar [value proposition](Value-Proposition) to Bitcoin. Having failed to do so it discarded the axiom, building the [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) we know today.
